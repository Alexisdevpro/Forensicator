# ABOUT

Live Forensicator is part of the Black Widow Toolbox, its aim is to assist Forensic Investigator and Incidence responders in carrying out a quick live forensic investigation.
It achieves this by gathering different system information for further review for anomalous behaviour or unexpected data entry, it also looks out for unusual files or activities and points it out to the investigator.
It is paramount to note that this script has no inbuilt intelligence its left for the investigator to analyse the output and decide on a conclusion or decide on carrying out more deeper investigation.

## Dependencies

This script is written in powershell for use on windows PCs and Servers. 
It has a supporting file WINPMEM for taking RAM dumps https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem
This script is expected to work out of the box.

```bash
powershell 2.* or 3.* | winpmem_mini_x64_rc2.exe 
```

## Usage

```python
# copy the files to the computer
git clone https://github.com/Johnng007/Live-Forensicator.git

# Execution
run Forensicator.ps1 <parameters>

```

## Examples

```python
# Basic Usage
.\Forensicator.ps1

# Extract Event Logs alongside Basic Usage
.\Forensicator.ps1 -EVTX EVTX

# Extract RAM Dump alongside Basic Usage
.\Forensicator.ps1 -RAM RAM

# Check for log4j with the JNDILookup.class
.\Forensicator.ps1 -log4j log4j

# Yes of course you can do all
.\Forensicator.ps1 -EVTX EVTX -RAM RAM -log4j log4j

```

NOTE: Run the script as an administrator to get value.<br>
NOTE: The results are outputed in nice looking html files with an index file. <br>
      You can find all extracted Artifacts in the script's working directory.
